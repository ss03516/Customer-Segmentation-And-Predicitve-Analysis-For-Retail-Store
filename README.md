## Problem Statement: 

The disruption of the COVID19 pandemic has caused drastic changes to consumers’ buying patterns in the B2C retail marketplace. With an exponential increase in e-commerce, the significance of accurate customer profiling and effective targeted marketing has become highly important for businesses. For this purpose, we intended to use K-Means clustering in order to identify the correct segments for the business. 
Secondly, targeted marketing is the key to successful business growth with the emerging e-commerce trend. Successful targeting can cause higher responsiveness from customers. For this reason, we intended to use classification models for predicting whether the customer will respond to the campaign or not.

## Summary 

For classification, our goal was to predict which customers would respond to a marketing campaign. In order to make these predictions we used six models with various implementations of each model. Those models are logistic regression, ridge regression, gaussian Naive Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest. We found that the random forest model performed the best.
For clustering, we wanted to come up with multiple groups of customers that have similar demographic characteristics among each other. By doing this, we can find out what particular customers are likely to buy specific products. Additionally, we can also find which particular customers tend to spend more money than others so that we can target them and generate as much revenue as possible. Furthermore, we can also use clustering to find which particular customers are more likely to respond to offers than others based on a variety of factors like their age, income, how many kids they have, how much they spend on particular products, etc..
